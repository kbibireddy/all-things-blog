### Campaign Breakdown & Strategy

* **The "Royal" Shot (Taj Hotels):** I used the beige scalloped umbrella to match the heritage and regal aesthetic of Taj properties. The "Amazing Publicity" branding is subtle but premium.
* **The "Resort" Shot (Four Seasons):** The green cantilever umbrella fits perfectly with the lush, tropical landscaping of a Four Seasons pool deck.
* **The "Corporate/Event" Shot (Audi/St. Regis):** I utilized the black promotional tent (which you uploaded) to show how "Amazing Publicity" handles high-end corporate events and valet services.
* **The "Leisure" Shot (Novotel):** The white market umbrella offers a clean, modern look suitable for business-leisure hotels like Novotel.
