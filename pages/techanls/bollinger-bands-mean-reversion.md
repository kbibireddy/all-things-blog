## Overview

The Bollinger Bands Mean Reversion Strategy is a contrarian approach designed to profit from price returning to its statistical mean after reaching extreme overbought or oversold conditions. This strategy works exceptionally well in ranging markets and can generate consistent mid-term profits over 3-6 week periods when applied correctly.

## Strategy Components

### Bollinger Bands Explained

Bollinger Bands consist of three lines:
- **Middle Band**: 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)
- **Upper Band**: 20-day SMA + (2 × Standard Deviation)
- **Lower Band**: 20-day SMA - (2 × Standard Deviation)

The bands expand and contract based on volatility, providing dynamic support and resistance levels.

### Setup Parameters

- **Standard Settings**: 20-day SMA, 2 standard deviations
- **Timeframe**: Daily charts for signals, weekly for trend context
- **Alternative Settings**: 20/2.5 for more conservative, 20/1.5 for more signals
- **Target Holding Period**: 3-6 weeks
- **Additional Tools**: RSI, volume, %B indicator

## Implementation Strategy

### Mean Reversion Signals

**Oversold Setup (Long Entry)**:
1. Price touches or penetrates lower Bollinger Band
2. %B indicator below 0 (price below lower band)
3. RSI below 30 (oversold confirmation)
4. Price action shows reversal candlestick pattern (hammer, doji, bullish engulfing)
5. Volume spike on reversal day (confirmation)
6. Stock is in overall uptrend or range (avoid downtrends)

**Overbought Setup (Short Entry)**:
1. Price touches or penetrates upper Bollinger Band
2. %B indicator above 1 (price above upper band)
3. RSI above 70 (overbought confirmation)
4. Price action shows reversal candlestick pattern (shooting star, bearish engulfing)
5. Volume spike on reversal day
6. Stock is in overall downtrend or range (avoid uptrends)

### Entry Rules for Long (Oversold)

1. Wait for price to touch lower band and show reversal signal
2. Enter on confirmation: price closes back inside lower band
3. Alternative: Enter on bounce from lower band with bullish candle
4. Confirm with RSI divergence (price lower low, RSI higher low)
5. Stop loss: 2-3% below the lower band touch point

**Target**: Middle band (20-day SMA) or upper band for stronger moves

### Entry Rules for Short (Overbought)

1. Wait for price to touch upper band and show reversal signal
2. Enter on confirmation: price closes back inside upper band
3. Alternative: Enter on rejection from upper band with bearish candle
4. Confirm with RSI divergence (price higher high, RSI lower high)
5. Stop loss: 2-3% above the upper band touch point

**Target**: Middle band (20-day SMA) or lower band for stronger moves

### Exit Rules

1. **Target 1**: Middle band (50% position)
2. **Target 2**: Opposite band (remaining 50% if strong momentum)
3. Exit if price reaches opposite band (full reversal)
4. Exit on stop loss trigger
5. Exit if bands begin to expand (momentum shift, not mean reversion)
6. Exit after 4-6 weeks if targets not hit

## Advanced Techniques

### %B Indicator

%B = (Price - Lower Band) / (Upper Band - Lower Band)

- %B < 0: Price below lower band (oversold)
- %B between 0 and 1: Price within bands
- %B > 1: Price above upper band (overbought)

Use %B for precise entry timing and to identify extreme conditions.

### Band Width Analysis

**Narrow Bands (Squeeze)**:
- Low volatility period
- Often precedes significant moves
- Watch for expansion (momentum breakout)

**Wide Bands**:
- High volatility period
- Mean reversion more likely
- Better for this strategy

### Trend Context Filter

**Best Performance**:
- Ranging markets (sideways movement)
- Weak trends with pullbacks
- Stocks near key support/resistance

**Avoid**:
- Strong trending markets (bands can expand and price can ride bands)
- Breakout scenarios (mean reversion will fail)
- Stocks in clear directional moves

### Multiple Timeframe Confirmation

1. Identify setup on daily chart
2. Check weekly trend (mean reversion against weekly trend is risky)
3. Use hourly chart for precise entry
4. Weekly context: Only trade mean reversion if weekly is neutral or pullback in trend

## Risk Management

- **Position Size**: 1.5-2% of portfolio (mean reversion can fail in strong trends)
- **Maximum Positions**: 4-5 simultaneous trades
- **Trend Filter**: Reduce position size in strong trends
- **Stop Loss**: Tight (2-3%) since targets are closer
- **Win Rate Focus**: This strategy aims for 65-70% win rate with smaller gains

## Confirmation Indicators

Combine Bollinger Bands with:
- **RSI**: Oversold (<30) or overbought (>70)
- **Volume**: Reversal confirmation on volume spike
- **Candlestick Patterns**: Reversal patterns at extremes
- **Support/Resistance**: Bands aligning with key levels
- **Stochastic**: Additional momentum confirmation

## Historical Performance

Analysis on range-bound stocks and market environments (2018-2024):
- **Win Rate**: 65-70% (higher in ranging markets)
- **Average Win**: 6-8%
- **Average Loss**: 3-4%
- **Risk-Reward Ratio**: 2:1 (shorter targets)
- **Best Environment**: Sideways/choppy markets
- **Worst Performance**: Strong trending markets

## Strengths

- High win rate in appropriate market conditions
- Clear entry and exit signals
- Works well in ranging markets
- Adaptable to different volatility environments
- Combines well with other indicators

## Limitations

- Fails in strong trending markets (price can ride bands)
- Smaller profit targets per trade
- Requires trend context awareness
- Can give false signals during breakouts
- Less effective in low volatility

## Market Conditions

**Optimal Conditions**:
- Ranging, sideways markets
- High volatility environments (wider bands)
- Stocks near key support/resistance
- Market consolidation phases
- Pullbacks in weak trends

**Avoid Using When**:
- Strong trending markets
- Breakout scenarios
- Low volatility (bands too narrow)
- During major news events
- Illiquid stocks with erratic price action

## Strategy Variations

### Conservative Mean Reversion
- Only trade when price clearly reverses at bands
- Require multiple confirmations (RSI, volume, candlestick)
- Trade only in confirmed ranges
- Tighter stops, quicker exits

### Aggressive Mean Reversion
- Trade all band touches with RSI confirmation
- Target opposite band for full move
- Use in weak trends (counter-trend)
- Wider stops, longer holds

### Hybrid Approach
- Mean reversion in ranges
- Momentum trading in trends (band breakouts)
- Combine with trend filters
- Adaptive position sizing

## Practical Example

**Oversold Setup**:
1. Stock trading between $50-$60 for 2 months
2. Price drops to $49, touching lower Bollinger Band
3. %B indicator at -0.2 (below lower band)
4. RSI at 28 (oversold)
5. Bullish hammer candlestick forms
6. Volume 1.5x average on reversal day
7. Enter long at $50 (confirmation close)
8. Stop loss at $48.50 (below band touch)
9. Target 1: $55 (middle band - 50% off), Target 2: $59 (upper band - remaining 50%)

## Conclusion

The Bollinger Bands Mean Reversion Strategy excels in ranging and consolidating markets where price oscillates around a mean. Its strength is the high win rate achieved when applied in appropriate market conditions. Success requires understanding market context, identifying genuine overbought/oversold conditions, and having the discipline to exit when mean reversion completes. The strategy works best as part of a diversified approach, complementing trend-following strategies. Key to profitability is recognizing when mean reversion is likely (ranges, pullbacks) versus when momentum will continue (strong trends, breakouts).
